# Hand Cricket
Hand Cricket is a game played in India at schools, homes, backyards, and streets. It is like cricket but played with hands instead of a bat or ball.

First, a team is made, that consists of an equal or unequal number of players.
The team captains toss with each other in any way but the Head and Tailares are the most common.
The winner from the toss chooses if they would rather bat or ball. 

The winning objective of the game is to score more runs than the target set by the opposition.
You score run by doing hand signs representing numbers like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6. If the number of the batsman and the baller is not equal the run 
is added to the batsman team and if it is equal the batsman loses their wicket and passes the batting to another teammate.
